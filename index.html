						<h2>What are Pueblos Mágicos?</h2>
					</header>
					<p>The Pueblo Mágico program was created to popularize cities and towns which have ‘magical’ attributes.
						 Towns are selected if they can show that they possess culturally significant events, stories, and legends.
						  The program aims to show that the culture in Mexico goes much deeper than what appears on the surface,
						   in the form of local mythology, local history, and family traditions.
						    These values which may not be found in other places in Mexico are what makes them so special (Clausen and Gyimóthy 321).</p>

						<h2>The Beginning</h2>
					</header>
					<p>The first Pueblos Mágicos were established in 2001. 
						The Ministry of Tourism elected 30 towns to participate in the program as a pilot program. 
						This bolstered their historical attributes and allowed an amplification of their culture. 
						The result being an improvement in how they are viewed by surrounding populations
						 as well as visitors  (Ramírez and Espinosa 222). </p>

						<h2>Eligibility</h2>
					</header>
					<p>In order to be considered for the program,
						a town or city must pass through a series of bureaucratic
						approval processes instantiated by the Mexican Ministry of Tourism.
						The program includes many requirements, including that a Pueblo
						Mágico be within a two-hour drive of another consolidated tourist
						destination, with “reasonably good roads”. This is in the best
						interests of both the Ministry of Tourism and the tourists of the area.
						It precludes many villages blooming with culture and character in
						the mountains of Oaxaca and Chiapas. (Clausen and Gyimóthy 321-322).  </p>

						<h2>Requirements</h2>
					</header>
					<p>The Ministry of Tourism is strict on its requirements.
						To be considered for the program, a town must be
						able to pass on several points. Preservation of local
						heritage is important and therefore they must avoid
						innovation to an extent. Local residents are required
						to be involved in the projects. Habits and customs,
						as well as symbolic attributes and original architecture
						must be preserved. Outside of the extent of these
						requirements, the town must have a minimum population
						of 20,000 people and be located less than 200 kilometers
						from the nearest city (Uhnák 9). </p>

						<h2>Benefits</h2>
					</header>
					<p>Alongside the preservation of local culture, and incentivization
						of tourism, government funding also greatly helps to improve
						the locals’ lives. Funding from the program provides jobs in
						the form of infrastructure projects which also provide education,
						clean water and sanitation.  Increased tourism results in
						an inflow of money to the local economy and increases revenue
						for common tourist industries such as hotels, restaurants, and
						guided tours. The artisanal market is supported by sales of local
						crafts and entrepreneurship is encouraged.(Zocalo).</p>

						<h2>Funding</h2>
					</header>
					<p>The Ministry of Tourism provides a tremendous amount
						of resources to be made available to designated
						Pueblos Mágicos. In 2010, the Ministry provided 
						1,900,000 Mexican Pesos to 35 towns in the program- nearly US$76,000 
						on average to each town. This funding allows these towns to
						transform cultural centers such as museums, and churches to
						be rehabilitated. The funding helps to maintain local culture
						from slow degradation, as well as make the towns more attractive
						for tourists (Zocalo). </p>

						<h2>Government Benefits</h2>
					</header>
					<p>Aside from the advantages of cultural awareness and a vast increase in
						business for the local economies, Pueblos Mágicos also benefit
						from the government. Coronado states that once a town is given
						the designation of Pueblo Mágico, its’ name is made available
						everywhere in the form of promotions, and guides for Mexico’s
						visitors. This provides visibility to incoming tourists. Travel
						agencies can help promote a more small-town tourist experience
						rather than direct focus into large cities. This reduces the load
						on overcrowded tourist cities and prevents them from becoming over
						barren and uncultured due to the large annual inflow
						of visitors (Coronado).</p>

						<h2>Requirements for Funding</h2>
					</header>
					<p>Although the government does provide support for these Pueblos Mágicos,
						they have several requirements in place to prevent municipalities
						from seeking funding without effort on their part. This program
						provides funding for infrastructure and training projects. Projects
						are only approved when they are deemed relevant by the Ministry
						of Tourism and they are not guaranteed. Every project that is
						approved must have, as an end goal, the tourists experience
						in mind (Coronado).</p>

						<h2>Their Impact</h2>
						<p>Since the program’s initiation in 2001, over 80 towns have been accepted and enrolled.
							 The majority of these towns were elected due to their indigenous origins or colonial legacy.
							  Some towns were enrolled in order to preserve their traditional organizational principles.
							   A select few have significant historical events that bring meaning to the visitors (Clausen and Gyimóthy 322).</p>

						<h2>Culture and Profit</h2>
						<p>The programs do well to support the local population, however
							there may be downsides. There remains speculation that
							competition for tourist money increases the likelihood 
							of trying to sell something vivid over replicating
							actual culture and heritage. Religious practices, through external
							influence, can even lose their own meaning. Music, dance,
							clothing, and language can be amplified to support the
							present scenery for the tourist’s sake, rather than being
							just a natural part of local culture (Ramírez and Espinosa 222). </p>
